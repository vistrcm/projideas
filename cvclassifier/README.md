# cvclassifier

The tool helps the recruitment process by classifying CVs.

## problem statement

The CV review process is error-prone, time-consuming, and often leads to mutual misunderstanding between candidate and recruiter/interviewer.

The idea is to develop a tool based on text classification technologies, for example, by libraries and techniques mentioned in [lesson 4 of Fast.AI course](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=4).

The tool should take CV as and input and classify it in of three categories: 
possible perfect match
ok
possible no-match

A recruiter can consult with the tool to prioritize "possible perfect match" and consult with a hiring manager on "possible no-match" before proceeding with a CV.

Another case: classify all incoming CVs and prioritize "possible perfect match."
